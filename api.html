Brand names and food categories are searched along with food names. Search results highlight matched user inputs. UPC lookup is included.</h3></li>
                    <li><h3>Search results are ranked by popularity among millions of diet app users. Unlike other DB providers, we actually know what people eat and suggest the most relevant foods.</h3></li>
                    <li><h3>All food updates are immediately available to your application. We add and verify about 300 foods every day.</h3></li>

We automate data validation as much as possible, but it still takes a human to ensure quality. Every change is double-checked by our quality assurance team.</h3>
                <h3>Keeping the catalog up-to-date is challenging since the food industry is a dynamic, ever-changing world: food vendors sell and buy brands, change their name while growing the business, change servings and clarify their nutrition labels over time. We meet these challenge with continuous monitoring and periodic, prioritized verification of such vendors and brands.</h3>
                <h3><span>PhotoFood</span> requests are processed within 24 hours or faster. We publish thousands of food updates every day while removing obsolete or duplicated foods. It's a live catalog.</h3>
                <h3>It is hard to avoid duplication because of re-packaging and re-branding of the same products and their slight variations. We remove any duplicates within 24 hours after noticing.</h3>
                <h3>We work with restaurants and food companies to add and update their menus and products in our food database. If you represent a restaurant or a food company, please email <span>info@mynetdiary.com</span> to get your products included.</h3>

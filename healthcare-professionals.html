                        MyNetDiary calculates target daily calories for up to 2 lbs/week weight-loss rate. If you

                        the daily calorie target manually.

                <h1 class="c2">Accurate database</h1>

                <p>
                    <span class="BP"> MyNetDiary’s foods database</span> is reliable with all verified foods, and there are few
                    duplicates in MyNetDiary. Before adding a new food item to MyNetDiary's database, the data entry
                    team checks that it does not already exist in the database so that no duplicates get accepted. Other
                    trackers use crowdsourced entries resulting in duplication and out-of-date/discontinued items and
                    dishes. It becomes more difficult to find and log the right foods, dishes, and meals, and their
                    respective calories and nutrients.
                </p>



                <h1 class="c2">No advertisements on MyNetDiary!</h1>

                <p>
                    MyNetDiary perceives ads and promoted stories as unhelpful and even counterproductive to user
                    success. No paid commercial content appears in MyNetDiary, even in the free version. Commercialism
                    distracts users of diet and fitness apps. The screens become crowded with highly-targeted ads about
                    various diet trends, supplements, and weight-loss tools, many of questionable quality and science.


                </p>


                <h1 class="c1">Community support</h1>

                <p>

                    MyNetDiary tracks eight nutrients in the free version and 37 nutrients with Premium membership,
                    including all major vitamins and minerals. Users can set personalized targets and reports based on

                <p>
                    MyNetDiary has a fast food-logging process. It employs a whole set of tools and shortcuts to

                    <li>
                        On the Food Entry screen, MyNetDiary shows all servings available and even your previous serving

                <h3 class="c3">Favorite food tracker</h3>

                <p>I’m a registered dietitian and this is my favorite app to track my food intake on. I love the
                    presentation, simplicity, and ability to make my own recipes. I’ve found this very handy in teaching
                    and maintaining my health goals.

                <h3 class="c3">Excellent App for patients, doctors, and everyone in general</h3>


                <p>
                    I cannot stop saying how amazing is this app. As a physician myself I have never encountered such a
                    complete app where not only one can meet weight loss goals, but do so in a safe manner, with
                    excellent recommendations by expert nutritionists, that above all make sure the process is safe for
                    you, so not to go into dangerous fad diets, unhealthy BMIs. As well, it has been such a learning
                    experience for me to realize how many empty, dangerous amounts of sodium, dangerous fats one can
                    consumed thinking you are eating healthy. It increases your awareness and helps you recognize
                    healthier options in food while filling satisfied. The free app is very good BUT the paid app is
                    unbelievable. I am not one to be spending money as many a times it tends to be a completely useless
                    purchase, not with this! This app is awesome. It is so accurate since you have an option to create
                    your own recipe and it will calculate the nutrients for you by portions. I recommend this to anyone
                    who not only wants to lose or gain weight but to anyone who wants to eat healthier to decrease risks
                    of so many preventable diseases such as diabetes type 2, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease
                    and many more.

                <h3 class="c3">Great app. Helped me tremendously!</h3>

                <p>
                    My Doctor showed me this app, because I was awaiting spine surgery and all of my activities were
                    curtailed and I was starting to gain weight. By being conscious of my calorie intake I was able to
                    lose 20 lbs. in spite of my lack of activities since my spine surgery. It will definitely help my
                    healing process by not carrying extra weight. I'm the type of person who can look at food and gain
                    weight. Great app, helped me tremendously!!

                <h3 class="c3">Easy to use</h3>

                <p>
                    Have lost 80 lbs , kept it off for over 5 years and find MyNetDiary app really helpful. It represents a call to consciousness around healthy choices . My doctor suggested it and is delighted with my improved blood pressure, lower cholesterol and now normal HbA1C!

                <h3 class="c3">Tried all the other food apps</h3>

                <p>
                    I am a certified personal trainer and decided to do the biggest loser competition with my clients. So to help them I used several of the food apps all at the same time. Then I tried this app. I have to say this app was the best out of all of the apps that I used. It gives you the most information and it’s the easiest to use. I highly recommend this app.

                <h3 class="c3">Instructor's review</h3>

                <p>
                    I taught nutrition at the college level for 30 years. I worked for Nutrisystem as a counselor and have been a private weight loss and eating disorder counselor for 25 yrs. I love love love this app. I have downloaded several apps, but this is the only one I use. I used to spend hours going over clients logs, now this app does all the work for me. I make all clients download it on our first meeting. I cannot imagine a better app. My clients also adore it!

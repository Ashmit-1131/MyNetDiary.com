            <p>You can lose weight with any diet app, even a bad one. Actually, you can lose weight using pencil and
                paper. Because it's YOU, not the app, who is doing the hard work. YOU are improving your diet and
                changing what and how much you eat.</p>
            <p>The question is, how easy, encouraging, and effective is your diet app? The better the app, the less time
                and effort it takes to achieve your dream weight. You don't want the app to hold you back. Choose the
                best app and get going!</p>

            <p>With the <b>highest user ratings of all popular diet apps,</b>  MyNetDiary scored 4.8 on iOS and 4.6 on Google
                Play out of 5.</br> </p>

            <p>Tens of thousands of happy users shared their reviews on the App Store and Google Play. Below you will
                find the most interesting and helpful reviews and success stories. Especially telling are thoughts of
                former users of MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, Noom, WW, and Lifesum. They used these other apps, sometimes for
                years — until they discovered MyNetDiary.</p>

            <p> Don't be distracted by ads and promoted stories about diet apps. Rely on real-life user reviews left by
                people like you!</p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Awesome and can be completely free!
                        <p>
                        This app is so awesome. You don’t have to purchase anything to be successful with this one!!! It makes logging your food and drink exciting. It’s like your waiting to see how *good* your choices are. Also being able to make 1 recipe and share it with others is such a great feature. I can send my husband our dinner and it makes it so he will actually log it. This app links with iOS health app to keep all your steps and it reports your water intake to your phone. Also links great with activity app for Apple Watch so I fell like it has a great sense of what I am doing. So many times I lost exactly how many ounces it predicted each day. It is as accurate and honest as you are!!!! Really love this app!!!!</p>

                <div class="item">
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Extremely user friendly & NO ads</p>
                    <p>I love the scanning feature that can be used to “rate” foods in the same categories to help when grocery shopping. There also isnt a limit on how many items you can log into your daily food journal. Other apps I’ve tried would limit how much I could input so I wasn’t accurately tracking all my meals and snacks. This is my fav and ONLY app needed for my new healthier lifestyle.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Way better than other apps</p>
                    <p>I started using this after being frustrated with the capabilities of my fitness pal. This was so easy to customize and I really like the weight tracker graph, it’s very motivating. Overall will be recommending to friends!</p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Gosh I love this app — preliminary review</p>
                    <p>I’m only two days in. I’ll submit an updated review after some time, and when I can provide more detail. But! Having used Lose It and MyFitnessPal, entering my daily intake has been ... a joy. Well done. If my opinion holds up, I’ll either subscribe to Premium, or send a generous one time contribution.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="item"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Set Me Free</p><p>When the WW app changed and made all the foods I had learned to eat to lose weight zero points, I know longer had a meaningful way to track my intake. This app was an easy transition and set me free to eat any sort of food and honestly know if I was in a weight loss position, weight maintenance position, or weight gain position. I love this app and it’s tremendous flexibility! I create food from nutritional labels, make custom meals, or find what I’m looking for already created. Very happy! For a while I used the free version, but saw no problem upgrading to the pay version once I saw the power and flexibility. Thanks for a great app and the regular updates.</p></div>

                <div class="item"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Great App!</p> <p>If you want a simple, straightforward app to track your calories and weight, this is it. Simple, easy to use without a dozen useless options you don’t need and never use My only suggestion to improve it would be to see a graph of my weight as I log it, similar to the Noom app. It is very exciting to watch the graph plunge down as I lose weight, but this app only shows your current weight. But better than Noom, it has lots of measurement options to choose from when logging your food. A great app that is very easy to use</p></div>
                <div class="item"><p style="font-weight: bold;">My Net Diary Review</p><p>I have tried many “diet” apps and found this to be the easiest and most straight forward of all of them. Have lost 58 lbs. An on maintenance now. Very motivating and intuitive.</p></div>
                <div class="item"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Saved my life!!!</p>

                   <p> This app saved my life. It helped me lose 147 lbs in 2 years. I learned that there is no easy way to lose weight and it has everything to do with calorie deficit. It was my guide and bestfriend through my journey. I never had to lie about anything just input my truth and my results were all my own. This app helps with everything from water intake to calories burned to my disappearing waistline. I recommend this to everyone because I truly believe in it. I learned so much about nutrition. My net diary helped me make the new chapter in my life and my families with a healthy lifestyle change that was an easy transition. Take the time and let the app help you be wherever in your life you want to be. You can do it if I did it!!
